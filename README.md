# Fundamental Search Algorithms

This project is a collection of fundamental search algorithms used to solve pathfinding problems in graphs. It is part of our Intro to Artificial Intelligence subject.

**Implemented Algorithms**

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

- A*

**Purpose**

These algorithms demonstrate the foundations of AI problem-solving by exploring different strategies for finding paths in graphs. They are useful for understanding concepts like search strategies, optimality, and efficiency.

**Usage**

Clone the repository and run the scripts to experiment with each algorithm.

```
git clone https://github.com/jksalcedo/search-algorithm-py.git
cd search-algorithm-py
```
